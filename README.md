# Web-Scraping-Project
This project is a Python-based web scraper that extracts tabular data from a <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_renewable_electricity_production> Wikipedia page </a>. It uses BeautifulSoup, requests, and pandas to retrieve and clean the data, then stores it in a DataFrame for further analysis.

## Project Objectives
- Practice web scraping techniques using Python and BeautifulSoup.
- Automate the collection of publicly available data from Wikipedia.
- Enable easy data analysis and visualization of scraped data.
- Lay the foundation for building a future user-facing interface.

## My Process
- Selected a Wikipedia page containing structured data. I used a page that lists "the countries and dependencies by electricity generation from renewable sources".
- Examined table tags and classes using browser developer tools (i.e. inspect) to locate needed data.
- Fetched HTML with requests and parsed it using BeautifulSoup to extract and clean table rows. Also stored data into a pandas DataFrame.
